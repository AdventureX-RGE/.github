## AdventureX 2024 Expose

🪄 Have you often seen these types of participants at various hackathons:
* Teams that repeatedly join with the same project just to win prizes
* Participants who lack technical skills and only want to be free riders
* Individuals who lack passion, seeking to start businesses only to cash out
* Thinkers whose ideas are dull and not at all SHOCKING
<br>
To address the "chaos" at hackathons, the AdventureX team has decided to host an unconventional hackathon and invites all "Contemporary Hippies" under 26 with skills in development, design, or marketing to join us in Hangzhou from July 15 to 19 for our offline event.<br><br>

* 🔥 Spend 5 days resonating with 200 like-minded "**Contemporary Hippies**" from four continents, all under 26
* 🔨 Extreme entrepreneurship, develop software, web pages, hardware products without any restrictions on product direction
* 🆓 The event is completely free, plus we will provide free cloud servers, extensive AI credits, web3 resources, and free collaborative software
* 🌟 Genuine partners like Liu Yuan, independent developer Tudalting, designers Allen, Haixin, and Awen will be guests at the event
* 🤖 Hardware lab, featuring 3D printers, VisionPro, Raspberry Pi, Monocle (AR version of Raspberry Pi), and industrial-grade hardware facilities
* 💰 A total of up to ??? million yuan in prize money and various gifts, plus participation from top domestic funds
* 🎠 Activities during the event will include sunrise hikes, cat petting, BBQ, and the Woodstock music festival

<br>If you are a "**senior hippie**" over 26, feel free to DM us on twitter (@AdventureX_Plan) to register as a "Guide," leading all "Contemporary Hippies" to create the wildest products and experience the full 5 days of activities!<be>

🚀 Join the 2024 offline event, and perhaps our efforts will help you find a place that truly belongs to you. No matter how many times it exists, years later someone will, like I once did, exclaim: "There, the fire of my passion for XX was truly ignited," or "There, I met lifelong friends"... This is the ultimate purpose of hosting AdventureX.<be>
